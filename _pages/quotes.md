Life's too short for toxic relationships

Life is a gigantic, silly game.

It's all temporary.

You can be anything you want.

There are many options available, one of them is "lazyness".

As you get older, you become more accepting.

I stopped expecting happiness.  
I stopped trying to be happy.

My life sucks and I know it.
Though, I don't expect my fate to suck anyway.

I don't expect less.  
However, I do expect huge.  
I'm just more accepting and grounded.

I'm not special, but I'm original.

馬鹿なこと考えていられるときほど余裕をなくす。  
無気力さの中で冷静になれ。

You need experience not mere logics and theories.
There's still a lot to learn.

My world doesn't revolve anymore, cause there's no such thing.
And this world isn't even my world.

The reality shown me disappointments.
I got to change my 'dreams', to synchronize it with this rotten reality.

I hate dramas, but sometimes slapping someone on the face is just so satisfying.

安全だと思うことこそが不安全を招く

To think something's safe, that's when it could be unsafe.

毒の正体は孤独感である

Loneliness makes you vulnerable

Never 100% trust others in important works or critical situations
-- do your best, look out for mistakes, don't expect competency out of others.

That's gonna be toxic with those arrogant and self-awareless humans.

Pay attentions to what might be going on behind the scene.

Don't blindly ask innocent questions and blindly believe their answers.  
Sometimes things are just so illogical, never blindly trust things.

Blindspot for plain logics is illogics.  
Don't play innocent logics.  
Or rather, no innocence!

Don't just think individually but collectively.

The world is teaching me why not to love the world, and how the world would harm me.  
Acceptance? No, opposition!


## 2022/4/4

Stop blindly changing yourself for others.

## 2021/10/22

Your eyes deny your words.

Hurt me, kill me, 'till no remorse left in me.

I'd rather be a disaster.

The world is hostile, therefore I am.

The world is an ironic bitch.
