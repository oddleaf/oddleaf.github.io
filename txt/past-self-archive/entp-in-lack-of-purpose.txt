Somewhy in recent 2 years I became pessimistic.

I lost my 'spark' and interest on almost anything and anyone. It makes me feel incompetent and dumb.  
It escalated to the extend of that I'm currently dwelling in a feeling of lacking excitement and purpose in life.

Fear of failure, tunnel-view, calculating, stingy with my time, time anxiety etc. sequentially became my thing as well.

Though it should has something to do with my lifestyle and worldview. Recently I disappointed by the fact that my very longing/desire wasn't something that realiseable.  

It feels like a broken ISxJ.  
Is it Si grip thing? In such a long time?

PS: my tritype: 874 sx/so. Currently 21yo.
