## shyness

IRL, I feel as if I'm emotionally naked and people just literally able to see through me that I'm feeling so vulnerable inside (inconfidence, inadequacy, embarrassed, full of flaws).

Yet it isn't always so, sometimes I appear 

I heard someone talks to their friends like "I was so awkward, It's embarrassing! lol" after doing something (they perceive as) embarrassing.  
From afar, I was like "what!? But you looked entirely confident! You must be joking!". After all, I don't even think what they were doing was anything embarrassing at all.  
Okay... maybe my 'common sense' was a bit different from their, or maybe because I was a spectator ―able to see it objectively― while the person concerned lost in their situation, the subjectivity.

After I've seen enough amount of similar situations
, it teaches me something
**

I guess it's due to that I tend to not put (that much of) 'mask', because it exhaust me to burnout.
Also possibly it's sx/so + 4 (fix) related thing that I want to 'show off myself'.

Also that's why I don't really relate to 8's description that sounds like "they deny their weaknesses and feelings".
Despite I relate to it's core desires and fears over other types'.  
That's because I'm aware of my feelings and weaknesses, and so in touch with what it called 'innocence of the 8'.

** Ne-Fe loop


- accept it as a part of who you are
- stay objective
- rationalize/ignore it

Okay, it's easier said than done.  
However I'm still working on it myself.

Hope it could somehow, help/inspire someone else out there!
