My feelings made of deep longing and frustration towards this world/reality.
It connotates strong melancholy.

If I let it speak for itself it'd sound like:

> I hate this reality I'm in, I want to be *there*, to experience *that* colorful world -- another *reality*. (internally tearful, melancholic, somewhat depressed)  
>  
> But I realise there's *no* way to go *there*, at least not from this point. Yet it's unrealistic to *only* long for it, I'd get really frustrated even more if I don't do anything for it.  
>  
> When I believe I can get it somehow and somewhere I want to fight for it, fight this *world*. (solitudinously optimistic, cheerful, as if being in a love, may neurotically believing any *tiny* possibilities which could cause disappointment if ever to stop being optimistic)  
>  
> Even if the world *I* want is realistically impossible to get, when I do accept that fact I'll fight for something else that's more realistic, but that time I'll close my heart, throw away any feelings I have, being totally numb as I can. Still, I want to impact the world for myself and hopefully for the better society. (still solo, may gradually being social, reject inner melancholy and feelings, serious, having inner flame, forceful, like a bullet; fast, straightforward, penetrating, “I don't care about comfortabilities, possibly not even my own self”)

I don't think any of these are really healthy traits; it's either go find lovely life or throw yourself to the abyss without looking back to the light, somewhat neurotic black and white thing to me.

The most healthy state I was able to experience myself was high passion and openness balanced with groundedness, calm, being able to deal with things I hate (daily logistics, routine) without being all or nothing about it.

When I was new to MBTI I thought I was an INFP, because of that melancholy part.  
I've been in that optimistic part and since I took off that clichéd rose colored glasses I lost some of my ENTP spark.
Never been really in that bullet part, am stuck in my comfort zone.  
Currently IDK what I want out of my life. Yes, it lacks dreams other than that 'ideal world'. I need to do something about it.

# Is it how it feels like to be an sx 8? or...

Just to clarify, I have 4 fix in my tritype; 874 sx/so.  

It feels like as if I have a needy little child inside me.  
It makes me feel deep longing, thirsty for love, lonely, needy, sad, feeling like a misfit and demands on being understood.
It happens usually when I'm unhealthy (in personality term).

Since I have no 'home' for my feelings, so I usually just journal it, (subtly) express it or just ignore it.  
I believe if I ever dare to 'release my handle' and let it control my behaviors, it'd result into something really ugly that I would feel stupid and ashamed of afterwards.  
I don't entirely hate my feelings though, after all I can control it.

Is it relateable? Maybe sx 8s? 8 + 4 tritypes?  
Or it's "just something else" unrelated to personality systems?

+ a bit of OOT:  
I think, that's why I tend to hold deep affections for yandere characters LOL (their love is *very* intense, they're also strong - the world is harsh I don't want to let them down).

When I'm 'under' an authoritative figures (eg. parents) I tend to be very demanding since I'm feeling like I have less control over my life if not to rebel and being independent, I'm very strategizing my steps below them.

I also have an inner longing for deeply loving and being loved. I'm very aware of my feelings, though sometimes I hate my feelings (loneliness, neediness, melancholy, thirst of love - may appear flirty out of this) because I just can't fulfill them and it disrupts my productivity so I may numb myself out or... journal it or express it (hopefully healthily).  
I don't think my feelings are a weakness because I can use them as a 'fire/energy', although if I 'loosen the tie' or let myself 'immerse' in it, it may bother me like a needy little child inside me *ugh*... After all, I can control them (eg. "just turn 'em off").

To me being free, strong, self-sufficient and able to protect myself+others is my biggest ideal. 
I rarely concerned about controlling others unless they could affect (negatively) my life.

And when I'm acting as an authority I become very protective (still on a healthy level - I value their freedom), educating, caring, *extremely* loving, possibly self-sacrificing, "show it by action" type of person.
Although it only happen when I do deeply adore and trust people.
I tailor my controlling behavior to 'strength' and dependability of others.

# Are sx 8s more in touch with their emotions?

I used to think I'm a 4.

I believe my tritype is 8w7, 7w8, 3w4.

When I'm in stress, depending on its reason I may become (internally) self-pitying.  
Although sometimes I'll just analyze and 'output' them to my private journal.  
On the other times I'll just put some annoying profile texts (implying frustrations or blame) in social media account exclusive for my family.
It sounds like "no warmth in my “family”"
And I realized that it's quite toxic.

I'm feeling so suppressed and out of control with my current life.



# Fe causes burnout?

Often, when I'm trying to be friendly (online) I bother too much with consensus manner, unspoken 'rules' of interaction (eg. punctuate sentences with emoji, throw in "haha"s, unreasonably using formal language) in order to *be* friendly that it caused me to 'burnout' in place.

My 'extrovert mode' gradually torn away, then I tried to look into myself I found that I felt repressed by being too much in trying to appear friendly.  
It was like trying to be something that I'm (naturally) not - I tailor my character to whom I'm interacting with.  
And literally after I figured it out my extrovert mode came back.

It happens to me mostly if not always online when I don't want to appear cold, while IRL I can exude my friendliness naturally regardless my way of speaking or the topic.  
It answered my long lasting question on why I tend to caught 'social anxiety' with strangers online, while it's completely OK for similar situations IRL.

I guess it's a Ne-Fe thing.

Is it relateable?  
How would you explain it using cognitive functions?
